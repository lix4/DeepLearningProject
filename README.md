# Tracking Block Operations

This project is part of Rose-Hulman's entry in the IBM AI XPRIZE Competition. The overall goal is to use AI to make it easier for non-technical people to use robots. The project is to use Deep Learning to automate the tracking of block movements from video. Over the summer we have constructed 9 wooden blocks that have expensive ($300) sensors embedded in them. The sensors can measure block acceleration and transmit these measurements to a laptop using bluetooth. We want to train a neural network to use video to predict the block accelerations so that video recording of the remaining blocks (which don't have the sensors) can be automatically tracked.
